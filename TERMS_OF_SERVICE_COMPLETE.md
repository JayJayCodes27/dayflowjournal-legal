Last Updated: January 11, 2026
**Version:** 1.22
1. Agreement Overview
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the DayflowJournal mobile application (“DayflowJournal”, “the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.
These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you (“you”, “your”, or “User”) and the operator of DayflowJournal.
2. Description of the Service
DayflowJournal is a privacy-focused journaling application for iOS devices that allows users to create personal journal entries using handwriting, voice recordings, and typed text, as well as optional mood tracking and organisational features.
All journal content is stored locally on your device. DayflowJournal does not operate user accounts and does not host journal content on external servers.
3. Free and Premium Features
3.1 Free Tier
The free version of DayflowJournal includes access to core journaling features with a rolling 7-day history limit. Journal entries older than 7 days may be automatically deleted from your device to enforce this limitation.
3.2 Premium Subscription
Premium access unlocks additional features such as unlimited journal history, advanced insights, export tools, and enhanced analysis features.
Premium access is available via auto-renewable subscriptions or a one-time lifetime purchase, subject to availability in your region.
4. Subscriptions, Billing, and Payments
4.1 Apple In-App Purchases
All purchases are processed exclusively through Apple’s In-App Purchase system and are governed by Apple’s Media Services Terms and Conditions.
We do not process payments directly and do not have access to your payment details.
4.2 Auto-Renewing Subscriptions
Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period
Your Apple ID account will be charged within 24 hours prior to renewal
You can manage or cancel subscriptions via iOS Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions
4.3 Free Trials
Where offered, free trials convert to paid subscriptions unless cancelled before the trial period ends. Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited upon purchase, in accordance with Apple’s rules.

Your privacy is fundamental to DayflowJournal.
